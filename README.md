# 21 seconds LaTex resume template  

This template originates to the next templates:

1. [Carmine Spagnuolo's Twenty Seconds Curriculum Vitae](https://github.com/spagnuolocarmine/TwentySecondsCurriculumVitae-LaTex)
2. [Carmine Benedetto's Smart Fancy LaTeX CV](https://github.com/neoben/smart-fancy-latex-cv)
3. [Adrien Friggeri's Fancy CV](https://www.sharelatex.com/templates/52fb8c1f33621a613683ecad)
4. [Harsh Gadgil's Data-Engineer-Resume-LaTeX](https://github.com/opensorceror/Data-Engineer-Resume-LaTeX)

I called it **21 seconds LaTeX template**
as it has more textual information. So that, it can take more seconds to read.  
I used it to build my own **JS developer** CV.

## How it works (Ubuntu Linux)

1. Install an editor to edit and compile LaTeX documents.
It works properly in [Texmaker](http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/) or [Kile](https://kile.sourceforge.io/).
2. Clone this repository using `git clone` and open the template.tex file in your editor.
3. Check if the next **texlive** packages are installed:
  - texlive-fonts-extra
  - texlive-luatex
  - texlive-xetex

**Important**: Make sure to compile with XeLaTeX, not PDFLaTeX.
